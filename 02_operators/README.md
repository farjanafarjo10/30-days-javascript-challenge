🔴Day 2: Operators

Tasks/Activities:

✅Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

• Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console. 
• Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
• Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

✅Activity 2: Assignment Operators

• Task 6: Use the + operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
• Task 7: Use the operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

✅Activity 3: Comparison Operators

• Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
• Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

• Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
• Task 13: Write a program that uses the operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

✅Activity 5: Ternary Operator

• Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

💨Assignmentn :

1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results. 

3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
