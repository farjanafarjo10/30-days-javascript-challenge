🔴 DAY 11: PROMISES AND ASYNC:AWAIT

💨Tasks/Activities:

✅Activity 1: Understanding Promises

• Task 1: Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console. 

• Task 2: Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout and handle the error using .catch().

✅Activity 2: Chaining Promises

• Task 3: Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order. 

✅Activity 3: Using Async/Await 

• Task 4: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value. 

• Task 5: Write an async function that handles a rejected promise using try-catch and logs the error message.

✅Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API

• Task 6: Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises. 

• Task 7: Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using async/await.

✅Activity 5: Concurrent Promises

• Task 8: Use Promise.all to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values. 

• Task 9: Use Promise.race to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
